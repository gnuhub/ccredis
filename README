:: ccredis ::

ccredis is a C++ redis client - a wrapper class on hiredis using STL (string, vector, map) and BOOST (scoped pointers, tuples)

CHANGES made in hiredis
	- All .c files are renamed to .cpp
	- Several 'static_casts' where added to hiredis.cpp and sds.cpp to compile hiredis with g++.

INSTALL:
	- Download and extract ccredis
	- Call 'make' to build libhiredis.so. The libraray is built in the current directory you have to move it later
	  for example to /usr/local/lib
	- Copy anet.h, hiredis.h and sds.h to /usr/local/include
	- To run 'example' you have to build it (see example.cpp) and set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	
HOWTO:
	You have only to include the ccredis.h to your source file and link "libhiredis.so"	


EXAMPLES:
	see example.cpp
